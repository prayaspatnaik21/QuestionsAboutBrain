## Questions
1. What is vestibular apparatus?

Ans. The sensory organ for the balance system.

2. How the Balance system works?

Ans. 1 .The Balance system gives us our sense of orientation in space. Its sense organ, the vestibular appartus is responsible for that.
    2.It consists of three semicircular canals in the inner ear that tell us when we are upright and how gravity is affecting 
    our bodies by detecting motion in three dimensional space.
    3.One canal detects motion in Horizonal plane , second in vertical plane and third in when we are moving forward or backward.
    4. The semicircular contains little hairs in a fluid bath. When we move, it stirs the hairs, which send a signal to our brain
    telling us that we have increased our velocity in a particular direction.
    5.Each movement requires a corresponding adjustment of the rest of the body.
    6. The signals from the vestular apparatus connects to a neuron in brain called "vestibular nuclei" whcih process then , and 
    send comands to our muscles to adjust themselves. 


## Learning

1. We have sense we don;t know we have --> Unitl we lose them.(Balance is one)
2. The Balance system gives us our sense of orientation in space.
3. Balance --> sense orgain is vestibular apparatus
4. Conventional View of brain sees the brain as made up of a group of specialized processing modules, genetically hardwired to 
   perform specific funtions.These developed and refined over millions of years of evolution.One of them is damaged , it can't be
   replaced.
5. Excessive use of anti-biotic gentamicin is known to poison the inner
   structures and can be responsible for the hearing loss,ringing in 
   the ears, and devastation to the balance system.
6. Our eyes help us know where we are in the space by fixing on the 
   horizontal lines.
